.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for displaying space used in AWS S3 buckets.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h , Fl Fl help
Prints help information
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version

If this argument isn't present sizes for all buckets in the AWS account will be
shown.
.It Fl o Ar mode , Fl Fl mode Ns = Ns Ar mode
Specify which mode
.Nm
should run in.
Possibly values are:
.Dq Cm cloudwatch
and
.Dq Cm s3 .
.Cm cloudwatch
mode is cheaper at the cost of some accuracy while
.Cm s3
mode is more expensive but very accurate.
Defaults to
.Dq Cm cloudwatch .
.It Fl o Ar versions , Fl Fl s3-object-versions Ns = Ns Ar versions
Specifies which object versions to sum the size of in
.Cm s3
mode.
Possible values are:
.Dq Cm all ,
.Dq Cm current ,
and
.Dq Cm non-current .
This flag will only be present if

feature.
Defaults to
.Dq Cm current .
.It Fl r Ar region , Fl Fl region Ns = Ns Ar region
Specify the AWS region to operate in.
If this argument isn't present
.Nm
will default to
.Dq Cm us-east-1 .
.It Fl u Ar unit , Fl Fl unit Ns = Ns Ar unit
Specify which
.Ar unit
to show bucket sizes in.
Possible values are
.Dq Cm binary ,
.Dq Cm bytes ,
and
.Dq Cm decimal .
.Ar binary
will show human friendly sizes using
.Dq SI
units (multiples of 1024).
.Ar bytes
will show the number of bytes used.
.Ar decimal
will show human friendly sizes using regular units (multiples of 1000).
Defaults to
.Dq Cm binary .
